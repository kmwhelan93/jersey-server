This project was generated by a script on the Jersey tutorial page https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/getting-started.html

It requires Maven to use. Download Maven and add it to the build path.

To test: mvn clean test or run as test in eclipse. Note you may have to hit junit tab to see results
To run: mvn exec:java or just hit play from eclipse

If you want it in eclipse, you can use the m2eclipse plugin. After installing, go File -> import -> Maven, etc


I like this project because it has tests ready and configured. It would be nice if we could add Apache Tomcat or something.
